This project is a **Nike landing page** built using **React + Vite**. It leverages the power of **Tailwind CSS** for styling and maintains a clean and organized code file structure. 

The setup is minimal, ensuring that React works seamlessly with Vite, providing **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** and some **ESLint rules** for code quality and consistency. 

Two official plugins are incorporated into this project:
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**, which uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**, which uses SWC for Fast Refresh

This setup ensures a smooth and efficient development experience, making it an excellent choice for building high-performance web applications.
